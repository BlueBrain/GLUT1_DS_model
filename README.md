# GLUT1_DS_model
The model presented in Coggan et al. Seizure and redox rescue in a model of glucose transport deficiency.
It can be simulated by running "julia sim_main_diffCond_therapies.jl" from the command line. 
Please see the code line 247 in sim_main_diffCond_therapies.jl to select which version of the model need to be simulated (replace 191 with any integer from 1 to 191). 

Please use Julia Version 1.6.6 (2022-03-28). Alternatively, you can run the model using Google Collab (make a copy, run and edit as you like): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18HwNMwfNijEh3AoKQXVAgnyagA3BPuhn?usp=sharing 

Figures making code is also provided.
